# AI Hands-On Brownbag

This repository contains a showcase of how current AI
technologies can be used in usual business applications.

## Demo App

In the folder [demo_app](demo_app), you can find a traditional 
frontend/backend application showcasing some out-of-the-box 
AI applications based on OpenAI's [ChatGPT 3.5](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt).
